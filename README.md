# Shortest-Path-on-real-road-networks
#### Finds shortest path between source and destination efficiently.
● Used Bidirectional Dijkstra along with
Advanced techniques such as Contraction
Hierarchies algorithm and A* algorithm to find
the shortest path on real road networks.</br> 
● It is faster than traditional algorithms and
accounts for finding the best route
with efficient time and space complexity.
